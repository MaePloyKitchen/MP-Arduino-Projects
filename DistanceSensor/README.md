Simple Distance Sensor Project

Description: Testing out the Distance Sensor and reading data sent along a Serial port. Combining the RFID sample project and the UltraSonic Sensor
project. 

Estimated time for completion -  30 mins

Bill of Materials:

Arduino Uno
Ultrasonic Sensor
Rfid Tag
Wires
Half Breadboard
A Stand of some kind

Wiring Portion
1. Make sure you have all the necessary components
2. Follow the wiring diagram provided in this folder

Arduino Portion
1. Open 'DistanceSensorRFIDProject.ino' file into Arduino IDE.
2. Make sure you add the MFRC522 and SPI Libraries. I used 1.4.11 For the MFRC522 Library
3. Hook up the Arduino to your computer and flash the code
4. Go into the serial monitor for Arduino IDE and make sure you get the RFID tag data and that your Distance Sensor works properly

Python Polling Portion
1. (Recommended) Set up a virtual environment for the Python program
2. Install the libraries listed in the requirements.txt file
3. Update the necessary variables in the python file to make sure your script works.
4. Run and test

Any queries can be sent to my Instagram and I'll do my best to answer them!

Will be updating this project in the future as well.
